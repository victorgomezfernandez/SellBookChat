# SellBook

SellBook is a marketplace for books, with the objective of giving a second chance to books that would stay unread and offering a fair price to the interested readers.


## Content

The project consists for the moment of a HTML document (index.html), a CSS document (styles.css) and a JavaScript document (left-menu.js).


## Important elements

In the index.html there are some elements that take the spotlight: mainly the LOG IN button (using a simple but satisfing animation), the side menu and the footer. I decided the colors (mainly black/dark and pink) to create something appealing that will attract the users.

### Log In button code:

```css
.button-slide {
    margin-top: 0.5em;
    margin-left: 22em;
    color: #FFF;
    border: 1px solid rgb(216, 2, 134);
    border-radius: 0px;
    padding: 9px 18px;
    display: inline-block;
    font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;
    font-size: 12px;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    cursor: pointer;
    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 0 #D80286;
    -webkit-transition: ease-out 0.4s;
    -moz-transition: ease-out 0.4s;
    transition: ease-out 0.4s;
}
```

### Side Menu code:
```css
#side-menu {
    position: fixed;
    width: 50px;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: #151725;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}
```

## Gratitudes:

I have used the next [web page](https://dribbble.com/shots/22892019-DeFi-Coin-Web-3-0-Platform) as inspiration for the design. I have also been helped by my classmate Alejandro Abreu in the ":hover" function or some design choices (for example).
